- Node 20.9.0
- Yarn 1.x (classic)
- PostgreSQL must be installed and accepting connections

On macOS, these [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) packages are recommended:

  brew install yarn
  brew install postgresql@16
  brew install redis
```

## Getting started

## Install - setup app

To setup a development environment (MacOS):

**Clone the repo**:

```sh
  git clone git@github.com:GoldenOwlAsia/rails-view-template.git
```

**Install Ruby**:

  This project currently uses [Ruby 3.3.0](blob/staging/.ruby-version), which is most easily managed through a version manager like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)

**Install Nodejs**:

  This project user [Node 20.9.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.9.0), which is most easily managed through a version manager like [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs), [rvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

**Install Ruby gems**:

- install bundle version 2.5.4 (or similar if you are using an older version on your development)

  ```sh
  gem install bundler -v 2.5.4
  ```

- bundle

  ```sh
  bundle install
  ```

**Install Yarn**.

  ```sh
    npm install -g yarn
  ```

**Install Javascript Packages**:
  Install packages:

  ```sh
    yarn
  ```

**Set the RACK_ENV (optional)**:
  Later steps expect a `RACK_ENV` environment variable, so define one (usually 'development'.) This can be done by exporting a value in your shell config (by adding something like `export RACK_ENV=development` to your shell configuration file - `.bashrc`, etc)

**Personalise the app settings**:

- Copy `config/database.yml.sample` to `config/database.yml` and customise the values as needed.
- Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and customise the values as needed.

- rails server:

```sh
  rails s
```

- sidekiq

```sh
  bundle exec sidekiq
```

- Vite

```sh
  vite dev
```
